            1958
            joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). He soon moved to the Indian Space
            Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, India’s first indigenously
            designed and produced satellite launch vehicle. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program
            that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earned him the nickname “Missile Man.”
            From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as
            principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His
            prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests established Kalam as a national hero,
            although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a
            countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming
            India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other
            measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic
            growth, and widening access to health care and education.</P>
